Welcome dear websurfer! I am Jean-Loup Adde, a french expat in London! I love building / learning / experiencing all the time. It can be learning a new language, building a new website or even learning how to draw (don't know where this will be going but I am enjoying it so far :smile:). Oh and if possible, I love to share what I learnt to the community with blog posts on [my blog](https://blog.juanwolf.fr) or [dev.to](https://dev.to)! Any questions? Feel free to ping me on twitter or linkedIn :wave:
