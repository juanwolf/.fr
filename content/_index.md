Welcome dear websurfer! I am Jean-Loup Adde, a french expat in London! I love building / learning / experimenting most of my time. It can be learning a new language, building a new website or procrastinate on my emacs config. When I don't, I am probably on my bike, chilling on my guitar, playing video games on [my Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/juan__wolf) or write some posts on [my blog](https://blog.juanwolf.fr)! Feel free to ping me anywhere! :wave:
